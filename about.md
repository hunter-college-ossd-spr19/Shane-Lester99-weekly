Hi. My name is Shane Lester and I am a software engineer living in New York City. 

Although I love to code, I have many other interests. I love traveling, meeting new people, trying new foods, staying in shape, and of course my dog, Shiloh. 

So why do I choose to blog about my journey as I progress as a software engineer through taking on open source projects? Why not any of my other interests?

Because, above all, there is nothing like the energy behind collaboration and creation.

That is what attracted me to technology in the first place. The ability to learn from others. To Teach others. To create with others.  There is truly nothing like it.

And although it may be scary to try to contribute to open source for the first time, maybe watching me struggle through my first commits might make it a little easier. So feel free to follow my blog and, just maybe, you will find the freedom in open source that I have.
