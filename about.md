Hi. My name is Shane Lester and I am a software engineer living in New York City. 

Although I truly love to code, I have many other interests. I love traveling, meeting new people, trying new foods, staying in shape, and of course my dog, Shiloh. 

So why do I choose to blog about my journey as I progress as a software engineer through taking on open source projects? Why not any of my other interests?

Because, above all, there is nothing like the energy behind collaboration and creation.

That is what attracted me to technology in the first place. The ability to learn from others. To Teach others. To create with others.  There is truly nothing like it. 

And I strongly believe that this aligns seamlessly with the spirit of open source software contribution.

So I hope you enjoy my weekly updates to my successes, struggles, and all that I am learning about the world through my first few commits to open source software.
