### Fulfilling the PR

Today me and everyone in my group are meeting up with the intention of spending a full work day to write most of the documentation needed. We aim to write 3 small sections of documentation and the architecture overview. The architecture overview is much more involved, as it will involve grouping together many topics and seeing the big picture. The challenge of this is that a lot of the information is in many different sources, and a big picture approach isn’t really anywhere. I have taken the lead on this part because it is my area of interest. 

The others will either help out writing some subsection of the architecture overview and others will write the small sections. I anticipate that we can write all three of the subsections and a portion of the overview. I believe finishing the entire overview is unrealistic, but we don’t need to to make a pull request. All documentation contributions are welcome, so even a subsection of the documentation should be fine to write. 

So let’s see how it all goes, hopefully we will finish!
