### How it went:

It went smoothly. We didn’t finish enough of the overview during that first work day. I had to write quite a bit more of it throughout the week. The smaller sections were simpler to write, and one group member covered all three of them. Each were only a few lines.

The overview was very involved. It took pulling information from lots of different sources and sometimes making inferences. Also some of it had to get deleted because it was not good enough. 

Everyone showed up though, everyone did their part even if they weren’t there physically. Overall it was an amazing experience. Everyone learned a lot and worked well together. Suddenly open source seems approachable. So everything in my opinion was a complete success.

The next steps are  we will make a presentation to our college community on what we did. Hopefully, for people who struggle to be part of things for fear of not fitting in, we will inspire them to get involved! That’s it for this blog series and hopefully everyone who read it was inspired to contribute to open source!
