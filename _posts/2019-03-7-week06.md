# Starting Cassandra: Three Potential Initial Commits

Hello everyone! Last week I wrote about how I came to decide in Apache Cassandra being my first open source project to contribute to. Since then, I have downloaded the application, played with it on my local machine, and learned a bit about its internals. [This](https://www.amazon.com/Cassandra-Definitive-Guide-Eben-Hewitt/dp/1449390412) book is a fantastic resource for anybody interested. [This](https://www.udemy.com/learn-cassandra-from-scratch/) udemy course is also good for getting started with Apache Cassandra. 

After getting comfortable with Cassandra's internals, concepts, and some basic queries, I decided to look for issues to tackle. Here is three I believe I could solve:

1. [This new feauture for the cqlsh client](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15046?jql=project%20%3D%20CASSANDRA%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)). I believe I could write this feauture because I think that the cqlsh shell probably could easily be updated to record and hold the data internally. Then, on the /s command, it shouldn't be hard to output the data collected in that session. Also writing a unit test for this does not seem to be too difficult.

2. [This bug that seems easy to reproduce](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15044?jql=project%20%3D%20CASSANDRA%20AND%20assignee%20in%20(EMPTY)). This seems a bit tougher then the above issue. However, I think that because the bug looks easy to reproduce, I believe testing and finding out why it crashes may not be too difficult. However, I think this issue also has the potential to go down the rabbit hole and lead to lots of frustration.

3. [This documentation that needs to be written](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/overview.html). This is a very good issue to work on. Not many people like to write documentation, but it has a lot of impact for a little bit of time worked. It can be done while getting more comfortable with the application, and the community will be very grateful for it. Also it is the first documentation section, so it should REALLY be filled out. Plus Apache Cassandra has millions of users, so writing the documentation that is there first frame of reference would be very rewarding. One potential pitfall with this particular issue is that it is an overview of the entire archtecture. This may be difficult to write.

4. [And this documentation that needs to be written](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html). Same as reason above. Except this issueis for a smaller piece of the arcitecture. However, it does not bring the level of impact as the other issue above, but it may be a better place to start.

5. Answering questions from the users, writing more robust unit tests, and reproducing bugs on Jira seem like great ways to contribute. The community will greatly appreciate it, and it will get me more comfortable with the syste,

That is all for today. I will post next week on which issue I choose and my next first steps into the Apache Cassandra community.
