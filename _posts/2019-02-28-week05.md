# Deciding On An Open Source Community: How I chose Apache Cassandra

Over the last few weeks I have been blogging about my experiences diving into the topic of open source. So far, I haven't contributed much to open source. I have written lots about licensing, the concepts of free VS open source software, my experience at meetups, and how to evaluate open source projects. Although I didn't contribute to open source software during that time (aside from adding data to Open Street Map), I have learned enough to choose and become a part of an open source community. When evaluating different communities to become a part of, I was looking into where I felt like I could become a long term contributer. The reason why I did this was because even if I don't actively contribute to the project, it allowed me to evaluate projects to see if they would be a place where I felt I could learn a lot for many years. That way, all the efforts I put in to become a part of the community will benefit me for years to come, and the benefits will compound as I get deeper and deeper into the project. I felt this was the better approach to take then to try to approach one with the intention of fixing a single bug and then leaving just to tell recruiters I 'countributed to open source.' I see open source as a way to develop my real skills and impact real communities. 

When evaluating projects this way I came to realize almost all the projects I was interested in were developed by Apache. I am intrested in distributed systems, cloud technologies, scalability, and everything data. Apache has technologies like Hadoop, Spark, CloudStack, MapReduce, and many similar projects. Because I want to learn these kind of architectures intimiately, I decided that Apache would be the perfect organization to develop open source for. As I developed for one platform, I will become more confident developing for others, learning the technologies and the arcitectures I am interested in in the process.

Another thing I noticed: almost all the projects I was interested in were programmed in Java. Sometimes Scala and Python as well. But Java primarily. I don't know Scala or functional programming, so I avoided the projects that used Scala. Although I eventually want to learn Scala, it seems counter-productive to learn a new programming paradigm right now. So I narrowed down my search to projects that did not contain Scala. 

That left me with lots of projects. Apache Nifi, Apache Hadoop, Apache CloudStack, and Apache Cassandra. So I looked at these projects and a few others to see which one seemed best to me. I immediately eliminated Hadoop. The reason being is because although I know it is a very important technology for large scale data problems, I dont yet have any experience using it. To use it, I would also need to learn its associated technologies. The learning curve seemed way to steep so it did not make sense to pursue it. Apache Nifi is a data pipeline, which is interesting but as interesting as some of the others to me. So I eliminated that one as well. That left Apache Cloudstack and Apache Cassandra. Both to me are extremely interesting. I am very interested in Cloud technologies, and learning how IAAS works inside is something I very much want to learn about. I am also very interested in data storage and distributed systems, and Apache Cassandra is a wide column store database that uses a distributed paradigm to store and query very large datasets. 

Both of these were the equally interesting to me. I decided to evaluate the communities. Both had extensive documentation of how to contribute, nice communities surounding the software, and seemed to respond well to new contributors. So I started looking at the issues. As I looked at the issues I realized something big about Apache Cloudstack: I didn't have the first idea what any of the issues were talking about! 
From there I looked at Apache Cassandra. I have programmed using relational databases, distributed microarchitecture systems, and some nosql databases, so when I was reading the issues, although they seemed challenging I think I could solve some of them given time understanding the system. Also I realized they were missing lots of documentation, which is a place I could contribute as i was learning the system! This I felt would be very fulfilling, I got excited as I thought about writing documentation that thousands of people would read everyday. From there, I was convinced, Apache Cassandra it is! 

 During that time I have now finally chosen the project I would like to contribute to: Apache Cassandra.
